                Blossom Rot is the nutritional deficiency symptoms that are mainly seen in Tomato. It is due to lack of
                calcium. This symptom have seen in my field too. The end portion of tomato fruit get damaged or seems like
                decayed similar to damaged caused by fungus.

                No management practices have been conducted for blossom rot. According to previous knowledge, it can 
                be solve by using egg-shell organically or application of fertilizer containing calcium. In my case, tomato
                are for household consumption and no fertilizer was sprayed. At later stage, whole plant have been died.

            I found bihar-hairy caterpillar as most destructive pest of cabbage and spinach in my field. They are both
            voracious and gregarious feeder. They are large in number during infestation of crops. They are found along
            with cabbage butterfly. I comment that it should be control in time otherwise all leaves will be damaged.

            For management of this caterpillar, i havenot used any types of pesticide since these crops are for household
            consumption. In morning and evening time, i used to go to field and collect caterpillar by wearing polythene
            in my hand. I used to place caterpillar inside plastic bottle and kept outside during noon time which result in 
            complete destruction of caterpillars. I think picking of larva is best remedy measure.

                Adult fruit-fly lay eggs inside young developing fruits with the help of ovipositor. These eggs hatch into
                headless larva which are more destructive although they arenot seem to. Number of larva terminally called
                as "maggot" are small and white in colour. They ate soft tissue present inside fruit and convert into watery
                substances. The fruit attacked by fruit-fly change its structure from normal shape. They started to bend from 
                region where it got attacked. Externally, plant look normal but from inside there will be formation of liquid
                instead of soft tissues inside fruit.

                    Fruit fly should be controlled in time otherwise no fruits will be suitable for consumption. In my field, there
                    was high infestation of fruitfly and like bihar-hairy caterpillar it will be impossible to control by hand-picking
                    so, i sprayed pesticide containing cypermethrin and chloropyrifos. Non-chemical way is to pick fruit damaged by
                    flies and burnt it or digged it so that no new fruit fly will develop.

                    Spraying of chemicals is the best way to eradicate fruit-fly. In my locality, trade-name FIGHTER and

                    100% success result. Biotechnological method such as use of cue-lure will be best to control population of
                    fruit fly.

                Bitterguard leaves. Grubs are yellow in color and number of grubs result in number of yellow marks in leaves.
                At first, leaves became victim and then after fruits. Number of damage in leaves result in wilting of plants 
                and fruits.
